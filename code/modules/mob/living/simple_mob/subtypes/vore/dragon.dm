	// Phoron dragons are a discovery by NT that was quickly classified when archeological dig sites near phoron deposits found strange crystalized skeletal remains.
	// Following the trails of these discoveries simultaneously lead to large phoron deposits and the rare discovery of live phoron dragons at the same time.
	// Most mining sites established by NT are pre-scouted for the express purpose of extermination and destruction of evidence in order to protect the discovery and the mining operations.
	// Considered extremely territorial, dangerous, and jealous of other dragons; making lairs and nests hidden and embedded in extremely volcanic areas or locations abundant of heavy minerals.
	// Claws are sometimes described to be strong as durasteel, always sharp and cold no matter their environment, traces of which can be found in unbelievably sharp religious artifacts
	// Although their signature is unique, the overexposure of radioactive energy and conductive metal make it almost impossible to use conventional scanning methods on the creature.
	// Their metallic and crystal diet is extremely demanding and hard to maintain, they're also known to supplement their diet with minerals found in living creatures.
	// Rumor has it that they create phoron as a complex nuclear chemical combination reaction and are believed but were never officially found to be a major source of it.
	// Their age varies drastically based on their diet, larger phoron dragons growing from overconsumption need more to be sustained and result in a shorter life span.
	// DNA results suggest other dragons devolved from phoron dragons when dietary requirements couldn't be met and meat sources had to be relied upon, causing 'inert' dragons.
	// Slime farming technologies and their ability to create phoron are actually a derivative science of studying phoron dragon digestive fluids.
	// Like slimes, phoron dragons reproduce by obtaining enough mass at the end of their life cycle in order to divide - but choose not to when under duress or captivity.
	// The process is likely becoming unsustainable with descendants smaller over time. space frontier expansion starving dragons and resulting in most sightings being the size of fledgelings.

As you push out in protest against the surrounding walls, you realise that the flesh feels squishy and sponge-like under your digits, coating them in dark, pink substance...
